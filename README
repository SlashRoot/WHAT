**SPECIAL NOTES FOR FEDORA**

You need to install the python-devel and postgresql-devel packages in lieu, apparently, of libpq.

You also need to install gcc in order to compile the image library.

The 32-bit version of glibc-devel is installed.  This package is "glibc-devel.i686" - any other glibc-devel will conflict, so uninstall all but this one.
