Very near extinction after having most of its function sucked up by commerce and accounting.  The only major function left in this app is the PointOfSale model, which is a literal model of stations where sales can occur.  This app includes the 'kick' method, which kicks open the cash drawer of a connected POS - one of our more exciting moments in coding.
