Handles actual instances of communication (phone calls, SMS messages, email, etc.).  Plays with various external services (ie, Twilio, Postfix, etc.) to deliver messages.  Ideally, this app is loosly coupled from the contact app and can operate with a degree of independence from its conventions.  This is probably our most portable app.
