Access Abstract
==================
People are very complex organisms that resist straightforward modeling.

The WHAT attempts to sufficiently introspect the underlying relationships between people to provide features such as permissions, groups, etc.

Goals:

 * Connecting trust with access

=====
Trust
=====
Bases for trust include how a User:
 * Treats and maintains the resources of a Group.


Trust is the basis for access.

The primary vehicle for reflecting trust is the Group model.

==================
PrivilegePrototype
==================
"Go behind the counter....."

=====================
PrivilegeJurisdiction
=====================
"...at SlashRoot."  

=========
Privilege
=========
Privilege combines PrivlegePrototype and PrivlegeJurisdiction.

"Go behind the counter at SlashRoot."

This model has the method that returns the big True or False about whether a User has access to a resource.




Trust is translated to access by the AccessBasis model.
