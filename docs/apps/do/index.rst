Do
==
This document describes the user experience of WHAT.do.

The Do app is the town square of our do-ocracy.

Browsing to its landing page, **/do/**, brings you to three-way fork where you can decide how to involve yourself.

The chief model of WHAT.do is **Task**.  A Task is any discrete activity, phrased in the past tense - anything from "finished painting the southeast wall" to "brought peace to all humanity."

Tasks are familial - they have children which are prerequisites to completion.  For more information on Task modeling, see :doc:`internals`.

==========================
Once you have found a task
==========================
So, you have isolated the task that you want to perform. 

If you **hover** over the task, you'll see the following information:

 * People who have already claimed ownership over the task
 * The DateTime that the task was created
 * The DateTime that the task is projected to be completed
 * The Task family summary (the first few parents and children)

For tasks which pertain to related objects, such as PhoneCall responses, you will see a short summary of the related object.

If you **click** on the task, you will see Task brief.  From here, you can:

 * Bid on this task
 * Own this task (if you have sufficient privileges to claim ownerhsip)
 * Mark this task completed (if the task is not top level or has no children)
 * The Task family summary (the first few parents and children)
 * Participate in discussion about the Task
 * Go to the full Task profile, which contains:
  * The entire Task family, laid on on a horizontal tree
  * Modify the description of the task (if you have proper privileges)
