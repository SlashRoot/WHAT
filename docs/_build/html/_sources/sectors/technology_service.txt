How to record action on a service project
=========================================

If an existing Device is discovered via User, Group, and no longer has a Barcode or QuickID,
affix a new one and append the last ID string to the updated barcode with some utility. 
(this requires sudo or some higher level overide permissions)
Checking with no prior knowledge  

Scan the Device or enter some form of Device ID.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a barcode is scanned, and the device has already been Pledged, but the Expectation is not Met, it means that we probably already have the device already.
*Prompt: Start new service Session?
What Symptoms are you attempting to resolve? (unless Diag.)
What Services are you about to Render?

Click Start
^^^^^^^^^^^
A Ticket is opened while device is being worked on. 
This starts a timer to track actual time spent. 
in some cases, with the right permission, multiple tickets can be open.
"Tech Utilites become Availible"

Click Finish

#. Each major action taken is entered into Service Logs. (Ticket Session or whatwever the fuck



How to check out a computer
===========================
#. Tech on duty scans customer barcode (stapled to their forehead in a previous step) to bring up session ticket. If barcode has been removed or tampered with, enter first letters of their name and pick from list. 

#. Tech finds all associated devices. If 3 barcodes show in ticket, there should be 3 devices found. Boink each one to release it. 

#. Payment is received from customer -=> redirect to POS screen with Service ready to sell as RealThing.  (Think, "Can I get you a hot cocoa with that?")
